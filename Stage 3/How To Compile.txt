First, ensure you have Java on your computer. Then, take the code and put each part (like the hotel's main code, the menu, employee details, and more) into separate files with names ending in `.java`, such as `Hotel.java`, `Menu.java`, and so on. Next, open a command prompt or terminal(I personally use powershell for windows). Navigate to the folder where your files are saved using commands like `cd`. Once there, type `javac Hotel.java to prepare the code. Finally, to see the hotel program in action, type `java Hotel` and hit enter. This will start the program, showing the hotel's menu for you to interact with.
