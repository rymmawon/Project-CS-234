The system also offers a checkout option. Its intuitive design makes it a simple yet effective tool for managing various hotel operations.

It boasts a method that efficiently calculates the number of nights stayed, using Java's LocalDate functionality. Additionally, it handles the check-in process by prompting users for relevant information and preferences.
