In my role, I focused on refining the user experience by eliminating redundant methods, specifically extra setters that gathered user information. I replaced these with streamlined text fields and buttons, consolidating the process and reducing complexity. Simultaneously, I took charge of establishing the foundational elements of the project's visual identity—working on sizes, fonts, and the overall look and feel.Furthermore, I played a key role in rectifying issues inherited from the previous stage. This involved addressing reporting discrepancies and ensuring that messages were presented in the correct format. By taking these steps, I contributed to a more user-friendly and visually cohesive project.
